# TimeMgt
Repository to build by TimeMgt project
I'm frustrated that Apple separates reminders from ical. I've looked at other offereings and found nothing I really compells me to buy. I have Outlook because I pay a subscription to Microsoft for Excel, PowerPoint etc. But Apple makes it difficult to sync calendars. Hence I would love to build my own product.
